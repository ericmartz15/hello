Practice GitHub setup for PSYCH 251 Problem Set 1

Hi all! 

I'm creating this repo for Problem Set 1 for PSYCH 251. This has been a great review of Git and version control, and I'm looking forward to using these tools for research instead of the pure programming assignments and projects I have done in my CS education!
