Practice GitHub setup for PSYCH 251 Problem Set 1

Hi all! 

I'm creating this repo for Problem Set 1 for PSYCH 251. The repository is primarily intended to demonstrate successful Git setup. There is one additional file in this repository called "pset0.R" which prints "hello world" and "My name is Eric!"

Looking forward to a great quarter!
